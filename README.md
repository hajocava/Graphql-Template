# Template Graphql

This template contains the **structure** and **configuration** needed for a project with **Graphql**, **Mongo**, **Express** and **Apollo-Server**. Accelerating the process of creating it.

It is only the part of the **Backend**. You can feel free to add your Middlewares and additional configurations.

This template is **ready to upload multiple files** with graphql

What makes this template great is the **division** in **small files** of its **schema** and their respective **resolvers** of graphql, allowing more control at a production implementation level.

It has a built-in **Authentication** to verify that the **token** generated by **jwt** at the time of **login** is valid in each **request**, in if the token is valid, a **refresh token** is returned for the client to **update** it.

It also has a **Middleware for resolvers** configured. You have to import the middleware and **Wrap** your resolvers in the. See the example in ```server/graphql/resolvers/user.js ```

## Optionally
Open the directory ``` server/config/env.js ``` and **edit the environment variables** of connection to the database, preferably create a user from the mongo shell.
